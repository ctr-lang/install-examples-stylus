# Grunt + ctr

Setting up this Grunt build example brought back all kinds of traumatic experiences I had back in my heyday trying to figure out Grunt. Luckily for you and me, I was able to get a little help through [Julian Ä†wirko's](http://julian.io/) [s-grid-grunt](https://github.com/juliancwirko/s-grid-grunt) project and more or less just plug in `ctr`. Nevertheless, even though everything works like a gem Grunt is just painfully slow and cumbersome, and I recommend you move away from Grunt as soon as possible.
